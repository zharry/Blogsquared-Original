Made a Index.PHP where there is only the posts and no admin at all. This is for a full site view without any buttons.<br/> &nbsp Made this because the < hr >'s won't extend after hiding the admin panel. <br/>3. Removed the DirectoryIndex form .htaccess because Index.PHP (posts page) is where everyone should visit first.<br/>4. Edited the look of Admin.PHP. Good start to the new styling.<br/>5. Cleared Error logs.</td>
